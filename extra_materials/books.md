## Nineteen Eighty-Four

[Nineteen Eighty-Four on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)

The book is suited better to an older audience. High school might be OK.
The book was published in 1949 after the Department of War was dissolved and the Department of Defense got its new name.
The book does not look much at technology. The technology used is outdated, but it does not matter as the focus is on the lives of the people living under constant surveillance.

> Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as "surveillance companies." Their rebranding as "social media" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.

## The Circle

In many ways a modern adoption of *Nineteen Eighty-Four*. Looking at what happens to you and thous around you when you give up more and more privacy. Might work for secondary school students to.
