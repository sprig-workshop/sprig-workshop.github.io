# Workshop

## Running the workshop

The [Serious Privacy Game workshop presentation]() contains slides that can be modified to suit running the workshop in different scenarios.


The workshop consists of four parts:
* Reality - looking at privacy problems.
* Meaning - looking at how to raise awareness of a problem.
* Play - looking at what makes a game.
* Technology - looking at how a player interacts with a game.

Trough these four parts the participant describes a privacy problem, thinks of how to modify a game to raise awareness, builds a game in the same genre as the one they modified, and tailor the game for a technology. The result is a concept for a serious game raising awareness about privacy.

The workshop is designed to be run with groups of 3-4 students.

The workshop has a set of artifacts, the first is the presentation with a introduction to privacy, a warm-up activity and run plan of the workshop with some extra information to give to the participants for each part. The workshop also has a *board*, a set of *cards*, and a set of *question cards*. All the parts can easily be printed and assembled. See the [print instruction]() for further details. The board is split into the workshops four parts. At the start of the workshop all parts are covered. During the workshop each part is uncovered one at a time revealing *instructions*, *question cards*, and *cards* for each part. the *instructions* simply tells the groups what to do and are the same as the instructions in the presentation. The *question cards* are cards that contains a set of question meant to help the group formulate their ideas in a way that makes it easy to present it to the other groups. The *cards* are sets of cards related to the different parts. They give extra information about the different privacy problems and about raising awareness.

Filling out the question cards help the groups present their ideas more easily to the other groups and makes sure they have tough about the most important part. Making sure the groups fills out the **question cards** during the workshop is therefore important.

Below is detailed instruction of how to run the workshop.

### Presentation
**Time 10-15 min**

The workshop supplies two presentations that can be used as introduction about privacy and serious games depending on the target group.

The [presentation for middle, and high school]() is a short 10-15 min presentation containing mostly video material in Norwegian showing what privacy is and why it is important to think about online.

The [presentation for adults]() go more into detail of what privacy is, what personal, and sensitive data is, and why privacy is important. This presentation is longer and not yet finished. It can be a good idea for the **facilitators** to look trough this presentation to get some more background to help discussions when facilitating the workshop. This presentation will be longer. 20-30 min.

### Warm-up activity
**Time 10 min**

To kick start the groups a worm-up activity should be run. Depending on the situation different activities are recommended.

* For classes where the pupils knows each other running [the workshops privacy Kahooth!]() is recommended. The pupils mostly need to get some privacy input and be active in some way.

* For classes where the pupils knows each other it is also possible to run the [the workshop privacy warm-up presentation](). This presentation contains mostly the same material as the Kahoot!, but does not require sound, nor that the pupils use a phone or computer to access the activity. The presentation contains a series of questions and the pupils are trying to answer the questions correctly first. Making them stand up and wait for acknowledgment before speaking is recommended. So is having some candy to give out as price for each correct answer.

* For groups where the participants does not know each other well, activities that makes them feel more comfortable with each other is recommended. No such activity is prepared at this time, but will likely be updated.

### Part 1 - Reality

**Time 25+5 min**

In part 1 - Reality, it is the privacy problem that is in focus. The goal here is for the participants to look at a privacy problem and understand its parts.

To help the participants getting started each of the **Reality Cards** are introduced shortly in the presentation. This takes about ***5 minutes***

The participants then gets ***5 minutes*** to choose one **Reality Card** before moving on answering the **Reality question card**

The groups then discuss the topic and answer the **Reality question card**. This should take about ***15 minutes***. *Remember to give the groups a reminder when it is a few minutes left so they get time to write down their ideas*

Lastly the groups shall explain their ideas to one another. Have one of the group members from each group stand up and tell the other groups about their privacy problem. They can use what they have written down on the **question card** as help. This should take about ***5 minutes*** it will vary on the number of groups, but make sure to keep this short.  


### Part 2 - Meaning

**Time 15+5 min**

In this part the participants will choose a game and modify it to raise awareness of the privacy problem they defined in the reality part.

After the instructions is read trough the groups will spend **2 minutes** finding a game that the majority of the group enjoys. The time restriction is to prevent the group from spending to much time settling for a game.

After selecting a game and writing down what game they selected on the *meaning* **question card**. The groups will then discuss how to modify the game to raise awareness about their privacy problem, as well as why the game should be modified in this way. This should take about ***13 minutes***. *Remember to give the groups a reminder when it is a few minutes left so they get time to write down their ideas*

Finally the groups shall explain their modified game to the other groups. This should take about ***5 minutes***. Changing the group member that presents is possible here.

### Part 3 - Play

**Time 15+5 min**

In this part the participants will create a game in the same genre as the game they modified in the meaning part, using the ideas they had for raising awareness for their privacy problem.

The participants simply get ***15 minutes*** to answer the play question card. Before explaining their game idea for the other groups. This should take about ***5 minutes***

#### further modification
doing a crazy 4. drawing up 4 images from within the game with a couple of minutes for each sketch.

### Part 4 - Technology

**Time 10+5 min**

The groups have now a privacy problem in mind, some methods of raising awareness, and a game concept ready. What remains is to design it for a technology. The groups first gets ***2 minutes*** to decide on a technology before spending ***8 minutes*** answering the technology question card.

When they are done answering the technology question card, it is time for the final explanation. The groups start by shortly repeating their privacy problem, how to raise awareness for it in a game, their game concept, and how it will be played. This should take about ***5-10 minutes***

This concludes the workshop.
